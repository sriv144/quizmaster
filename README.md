## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3** and **pip** installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/sriv144/quizmaster.git](https://github.com/sriv144/quizmaster.git)
    cd quizmaster
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    * It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```sh
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * **On Windows:**
        ```sh
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    * Install all the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables** (Optional)
    * If your app uses a `.env` file for configuration (like a secret key), create it now.
    ```env
    FLASK_APP=app.py
    FLASK_ENV=development
    SECRET_KEY='your_super_secret_key'
    ```

5.  **Run the Application**
    * Start the Flask development server.
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```
    Your application should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`!
